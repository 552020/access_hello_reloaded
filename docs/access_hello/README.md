# `access_hello`

This is a sample application developed following the tutorial at [Internet Computer Developer Tutorial Level 3.6](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-3/3.6-motoko-lvl3). You can find step-by-step instructions and a video walkthrough on that page.

The `access_hello` focus on authentication/authorization leveraging the principal of the [developer identities](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/identities), which is mainly convered in the [Using caller identification](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/writing-motoko/caller-id). It is important to notice that even if the app are dealing with users, all the identities interacting with the app are 'developer identities, created with [`dfx identity`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-identity)

Other topics covered in the tutorial are:

- [Types Variant](https://github.com/Web3NL/motoko-book/blob/main/src/common-programming-concepts/types/variants.md). Note that there are other docs about type variant in Motoko. The one listed above is the more clear of them all

## API Reference

The canister exposes the following public functions:

- `greet(name: Text)`: Returns a personalized greeting based on the caller's role
- `assign_role(assignee: Principal, new_role: ?Role)`: Assigns a role to a principal (requires admin privileges)
- `request_role(role: Role)`: Allows users to request a specific role
- `callerPrincipal()`: Returns the principal of the caller
- `my_role()`: Returns the role of the caller
- `my_role_request()`: Returns any pending role request for the caller
- `get_role_requests()`: Returns all role requests (admin only)
- `get_roles()`: Returns all assigned roles (admin only)

## Creating an owner identity

First, let's create a new identity to use. You'll call this identity 'owner', since it will be the owner of the canister you create:

```bash
dfx identity new owner
dfx identity use owner
```

## Default README from `dfx new`

Welcome to your new `access_hello` project and to the Internet Computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `access_hello`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd access_hello/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
